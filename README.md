## Overview

This project is a sample cutout from a personal project showcasing a React-based store management system. It demonstrates the use of various React features and libraries, including state management, API integration with Axios, and Material-UI for styling and components.

**Note**: This example is missing styling because the original project uses a proprietary template with very minimal changes on my end. The template is not included in this example.

## Technologies and Frameworks

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for building responsive and accessible web applications.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **React Router**: A library for routing in React applications.
- **Formik**: A library for building forms in React.
- **Yup**: A JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
- **React Query**: A library for fetching, caching, and updating data in React applications.
